Here is the comprehensive plan for implementing the backend functionalities for the MCQ-based test system:

### Plan:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure the database schema is correctly set up with the necessary tables: `Users`, `Profile`, `Questions`, `Tests`, `Test_Questions`, `Student_Test`, `Feedback`, `NLP_Generated_Questions`, and `Test_Assignments`.
   - Implement any necessary migrations to reflect the latest schema changes.

2. **User Management**:
   - Create APIs for user registration, login, and profile management.
   - Implement role-based access control to differentiate between teachers and students.

3. **Question Management**:
   - Develop CRUD APIs for managing questions, including adding, editing, deleting, and retrieving questions.
   - Ensure questions can be categorized by subject, topic, and difficulty.

4. **Test Management**:
   - Create APIs for teachers to create, update, and delete tests.
   - Implement functionality to assign tests to students, including setting time limits and passing criteria.

5. **Test Execution and Evaluation**:
   - Develop APIs for students to attempt tests and submit answers.
   - Implement automatic evaluation of submitted answers and provide real-time feedback.

6. **Feedback System**:
   - Create APIs for teachers to provide feedback on student performance.
   - Implement functionality for students to view feedback.

7. **NLP Integration**:
   - Develop functionality to generate MCQs from input text using NLP techniques.
   - Create APIs to handle the generation and retrieval of NLP-generated questions.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Perform thorough testing of all APIs to ensure they function correctly and handle edge cases.
   - Validate the integration of the frontend with the backend APIs.

### Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the implementation of the APIs and database interactions.
- Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure the system meets the requirements.
- Prepare documentation for the API endpoints and usage.
